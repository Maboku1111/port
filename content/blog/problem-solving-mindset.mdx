# Engineering a Problem-Solving Mindset 🧠

The best engineers **don't just solve problems**—they redefine them.

## 🔍 How to Approach Problems
1. **Understand the Root Cause** – Ask "Why?" at least 5 times.
2. **Think in Systems** – Everything is connected.
3. **Iterate & Prototype** – Test small before scaling big.

A true innovator sees **challenges as opportunities** rather than obstacles.
