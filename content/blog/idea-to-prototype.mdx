# From Idea to Prototype: The Engineering Process ⚙️

Every great product starts as a **simple idea**.

## 🔄 The 5-Step Engineering Process
1. **Identify the Problem** – Who needs this? Why?
2. **Research & Brainstorm** – Gather data and explore alternatives.
3. **Design & Develop** – Create mockups or blueprints.
4. **Prototype & Test** – Iterate based on feedback.
5. **Launch & Scale** – Bring the solution to market.

Innovation is **never** a straight path—**embrace the iterations**.
